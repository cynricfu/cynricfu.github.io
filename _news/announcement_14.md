We propose [Guided Hybrid Policy Optimization (GHPO)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10628) â€” a difficulty-aware RLVR framework that improves training stability and reasoning performance in LLMs, achieving strong gains on challenging math benchmarks. Code is available [here](https://github.com/hkgc-1/GHPO).
