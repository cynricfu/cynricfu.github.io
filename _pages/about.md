I'm currently a PhD candidate at the [Department of Computer Science and Engineering](https://www.cse.cuhk.edu.hk/) of [The Chinese University of Hong Kong](https://www.cuhk.edu.hk/) under the supervision of [Prof. Irwin King](https://www.cse.cuhk.edu.hk/irwin.king/) in the [Machine Intelligence and Social Computing Lab](https://misc-lab.cse.cuhk.edu.hk/).

My research interests lie in machine learning algorithms for graph-structured data, with a focus on **heterogeneous graph neural networks** and **federated graph learning**.

I'm open to any forms of collaborations. We welcome undergraduates, postgraduates, or other potential PhD applicants to visit our research group. Feel free to drop me an email if you are interested.

I love Sci-Fi novels, movies, and games. Cyberpunk, space exploration, time travelðŸ˜‰.
