I am currently a full-time research engineer at [Huawei Noah's Ark Lab](https://noahlab.com.hk/). Before joining Huawei, I obtained my PhD degree from [The Chinese University of Hong Kong](https://www.cuhk.edu.hk/) in 2024, under the supervision of [Prof. Irwin King](https://www.cse.cuhk.edu.hk/irwin.king/) in the [Machine Intelligence and Social Computing Lab](https://misc-lab.cse.cuhk.edu.hk/).

My research interests during my PhD study lie in machine learning algorithms for graph-structured data, with a focus on heterogeneous graph neural networks and federated graph learning.

Our team at Huawei focuses on developing AI solutions for [Xiaoyi/Celia Intelligent Assistant](https://consumer.huawei.com/cn/mobileservices/celia/). We are looking for experienced researchers/engineers or fresh graduates with strong **natural language processing**, **multimodal machine learning**, or **AI agent** background to join us. We also welcome researchers from the academia to discuss potential collaborations with us. Feel free to drop me an email if you are interested.

I love Sci-Fi novels, movies, and games. Cyberpunk, space exploration, time travelðŸ˜‰.
